# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving **AES-256-Lab**!

## Project principles
- **Education first:** readability and didactics are more important than micro-optimizations
- **Transparency:** avoid unnecessary dependencies and “magic”
- **Small steps:** keep pull requests focused and easy to review

## How to contribute
1. Open an Issue (bug / improvement / question), or directly propose a Pull Request
2. Describe **what** you changed and **why**
3. If you touch crypto-relevant logic, include at least one of:
   - a reference (e.g. test vectors, standard document)
   - a short verification note (what you compared against)
   - additional tests

## Style notes
- Keep comments clear (German is fine — the main project language is German)
- Prefer explicit names over abbreviations where it improves understanding
- When changing explanations, also update `docs/` if needed
